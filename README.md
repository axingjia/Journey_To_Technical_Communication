# Journey_To_Technical_Communication

# Chapter 1: Introduction

This time I will read the "Technical Communication" by Mike Markel. Let the learning begin!

All technical communication documents-whether emails, reports, websites, or any of a dozen other forms--are meant to help people learn, carry out tasks, and make decisions.

Example of written communication:
* a memo or email to request information or to identify a problem
* a wiki with instructions that explain how to carry out a new task
* a proposal to persuade management to authorize a project 
* a report to document a completed project 
* an oral presentation to explain a new policy to employees
* inquiry letters, sales letters, goodwill letters, and claim and adjustment letters to customers, clients, and suppliers
* Websites to describe and sell products and to solicit job applications
* Podcasts, videos, and posts on social-networking sites to introduce new products and services
* research reports for external organizations
* articles for trade and professional journals

**Technical communication is the process of finding and using information and sharing meaning**

* Much of what you read every day--textbooks, computer-based training videos, procedure manuals, websites, owner's manuals--is technical communication.

You are likely to have three major roles as a communicator when:
* The writer of a document
* A member of a project team
* An information resource for people inside and outside your organization.

**Almost every technical document has six major characteristics: address particular readers, help reader solve problems, reflects the organization's goal and culture, is produced collaboratively, users design to increase readability, and consists of words or images or both**
* For example, when writing a proposal for your supervisor, you might think of that person's job responsibilities, the level of detail he would be interested in, and personal factors such as history with the organization and attitudes toward your ideas. These factors help you decide what kind of document to write, how to structure it, how much detail to include, and what sentence style and vocabulary to use.
* **Your writing might also be read by people you never intended as your audience: managers and executives in your organization, the public, or the press. Avoid writing anything that will embarass you or your organization if other audience read it.**

# Chapter 2: Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations
* right, justice, utility, care
* Your ethical oblication: to your employer, to the public, and to the environment.
* Obligation to your employer: competence and diligence. Generoisity, honesty and candor, confidentiality
* Your legal obligation: copyright law, trademark law, contract law

# Chapter 3: Writing Technical Documents

SKIM

#### Determining Your Purpose
* Communicating verbs: aurthoize, define, describe, explain, illustrate, inform, outline, present, review, summarize
* Convincing verbs: assess, evaluate, forecast, propose, recommend, request
* gaining management's approval: before you actually start to write an outline or gather the information you need, spend another 10 or 15 mintues making sure your primary reader agrees with your thinking by submitting to your supervisor a brief description of your plans. You don't want to waste days or even weeks working on a document that won't fulfill its purose. If you have misunderstood what your supervisor wants, it is far easier to fix the problem at this early stage.

Here is an example of the description you might submit to your boss about the CAD's equipment. In composing this description of her plan, the writer drew on audience profile sheets for her two principle readers. She describes a logical, rational strategy for proposing the equipment purchase.

Juan:
Please tell me if you think this is a good approach for the proposal on CAD equipment.(the purpose of the memo)    
Outright purchase of the complete system will cost more than $1,000, so you would have to approve it and send it on for Tina’s approval. (I’ll provide leasing costs as well.) I want to show that our CAD hardware and software are badly out­of­date and need to be replaced. I’ll be thorough in recommending new equipment, with independent evaluations in the literature, as well as product demonstrations. The proposal should specify what the current equipment is costing us and show how much we can save by buying the recommended system.
(a statement of the audience of the proposal, a statement of the purpose, follwed by early statement of the scope of the document)

I’ll call you later today to get your reaction before I begin researching what’s available.
Renu (a statement of how the writer intends to follow up on this memo)

##### Revising Information For a New Audience and Purpose
SKIM 

# Chapter 6: Researching Your Subject

##  Understanding the Research Process 
* Analyze Your Audience: Who are your most important readers? What are their personal characteristics, their attitude toward your subject, their motivations for reading? If you are writing to an expert audience that might be skeptical about your message, you need to do a lot of research to gather the evidence for a convincing argument ->
* Analyze Your Purpose: Why are you writing? Understanding your purpose helps you understand the types of information reader will expect. Think in terms of what you want your readers to know or believe or do after they finish reading your document. ->
* Analyze Your Subject: What do you already know about your subject? What do you still need to find out? Using techniques such as freewriting and brainstorming. You can determine those aspects of the subject you need to investigate->
* Visualize the deliverable: What application will you need to deliver: A proposal, a report, a website? What kind of oral presentation will you need to deliver? ->
* Work out a schedule and a budget for the project: When is the deliverable--the document of the presentation--due? Do you have a budget for phone calls, database searches, or travel to libraries or other sites? ->
* Determine what information will need to be part of that deliverable: Draft an outline of the contents, focusing on the kinds of information that readers will expect to see in each part 
* Determine what information you still need to acquire: Make a list of the pieces of information you don't yet have.
* Create questions you need to answer in your deliverable: Writing the questions in a list forces you to think carefully about your topic. One question suggests another, and soon you have a lengthy list that you need to answer ->
* Conduct secondary research: Study journal articles and web-0based sources such as online journals, discussion boards, blogs, and podcasts.->
* Conduct primary research: You can answer some of your questinos by consulting company records, by interviewing experts in your organization, by distributing questionnaires, and by interviewing other people in your organization and industry 
* Evaluate your information: Once you have your information, you need to evaluate its quality: is it accurate, comprehensive, unbiased, and current?
* Do More Research: If you the information you have acquired doesn't sufficiently answer your questions, do more research. And if you have thought of additional questions that need to be answered, do more research. When do you stop doing research? You will stop only when you think you have enough high-quality information to create the deliverable.

###### Choosing Appropriate research methods

# Chapter 7: Organizing Your Information 
* Understanding three principles for organizing technical information. Follow these three principles in organizing your information: analyze your audience and purpose. Use conventional patterns of organization. Display your organizational pattern prominently.

### Analyzing Your Audience and Purpose 
* Will your audience like the message you will present? If so, announce your main point early in th edocument. If not, consider a pattern that presents your important evidence before your main message.
* Is your audience used to seeing a particular pattern in the kind of document you will be writing? If they are, you will probably want to use that pattern, unless you have a good reason to use a different one.
* What is your purpose in writing the document. Do you want your audience to understand a body of infomration or to accept a point of view and perhaps act on it? One purpose might call for a brieft report without any appendixesl the other might require a detailed report, complete with appendixes.
* If you are addressing people from other cultures, remember that organizational patterns can vary from culture to culture. If you can, study documents written by people from the culture you are addressing to see whether they favor an organizational pattern different from yours.

### Using Conventional Patterns of Organization 
* chronological pattern 
* spatial pattern 
* In a proposal, for example, you include a budget, which you put near the end or in an appendix.

### Displaying your Organizational Pattern Prominently 
* Create a detailed table of contents. If your document has a table of contents, including at least two levels of headings helps readers find the information they seek.
* Use heading liberally. Heading break up the text, making your page more interesting visually. They also communicate the subject of the section and improve readers' understanding
* Use topic sentences at the beginning of your paragraphs. The topic sentence announce the main point of a paragraph and helps the reader understand teh details that follow. 

### Basic Organizational pattern
* If you want to: explain events that occured or might occur or tasks that reader is to carry out-> Chronological or reverse chronology. For example, you describe the process used to disgnose the problem with the accounting software. Or in a resume, you describe your more-recent jobs before your less-recent ones.
* Describe a physical object or scene, such as a device or a location->Spatial, top-to-bottom, east to west, or inside-to-outside. For example, you describe the three buildings that will make up the new production facility.
* Explain a complex situation, such as the factors that led to a problem or the theory that underlies a process->General to specific. Understanding the big picture helps readers understand the details. For example, you explain the major changes and details of a law mandating the use of a new refrierant in cooling system 
* Present a set of factors-> More important to less important. In technical communication, you don't want to create suspense. You want to present the most important information first. For example, when you launch an ew product, you discuss market niche, competition, and then pricing
* Present similiarities and differences between two or more items-> Comparison and contrast. 2 options: 1. discuss all the factors related to one item, then all the factors related to the next item, and so forth; 2. discuss one factor as it relates to all the items, then another factor as it relates to all the items, and so forth. For example, you discuss the strengths and weakness of three companies bidding on a contract your company is offering.
* Assign items to logical categories or discuss the elements that make up a single item-> Classification and partition. Classification involves placing items into categories according to some basis. Partition involves breaking a single item into its major elements. For example, you group the motors your company manufactures according to the fuel they bum: gasoline or diesel. Or you explain the operation of each major component of one of your motors. 
* Discuss a problem you encountered, the steps you took to address the problem, and the outcome of solution-> Problem methods, solution. You can use this pattern in discussing the past, the present, or the future. Reader understand this organizational pattern because they use it in their everyday lives. For example, in describing how your company is responding to a new competitor, you discuss the problem (the recent loss in sales), the methods(how you plan to examine your product line and business practices), and the solution (which changes will help your company remain competitive)
* Discuss the factos that led to(or will lead to) a given situation, or teh effects that a situation led to or will lead to-> Cuase and effect. You can start from causes and speculate about effects, or start with the effect and work backward to determine the causes. For example, you discuss factors that you think contributed to a recent sales dip for one of your products. Or you explain how you think changes to an existing product will affect its sales.

* Long, complex argument often require several organizational patterns. For instance, one part of a document might be a causal analysis of the problem you are writing about, and another might be a comparison and contrast of two options for solving that problem

###### Chronological 
* accident report: the events in the order in which they occured 
* background section of a report: the events that led to the present situation 
* reference manual: how to carry out a task by describing the steps in sequence.
* When you use chronology, you are just explaining what happened in what sequence, but you are not neccessarily explaining why or how an event occured or what it means.

###### Spatal 
* in accident report: describe the physical scene of the accident 
* feasibility study about building a facility: describe the property on which it would be build 
* Proposal to design a new microchip: describe the layout of the new chip 

###### General to Specific 
* In a report, an executive summary
* In a set o instruction: Provide the general informtion about the necessary tools and materials and about safety measures before providing the step-by-step instruction 
* In a blog: describe the topic of the blog before presenting the individual blog posts.

###### More Important to Less Important
* a feasibility study about building a facility: you present the major reasons that the proposed iste is appropriate, then the minor reasons
* In a proposal to design a new microchip, you describe the major applications for the new chip, then the minor applications
* For most document, it's from most important to less important because readers want to get to the bottom line as soon as possible. But sometimes it's different. People who write for readers outside their own company often reverse the more-important-to-less-important pattern because they watn to make sure their audience reads the whole disucssion. 
* This pattern is also popular with writers who are delivering bad news. For instance, if you want to justify recommending that your organization not go ahead with a popular plan, the reverse sequence les you explain the problems with the popular plan before you present the plan you recommend. Otherwise, readers might start to formulate objections before you have had a chance to explain your position.
* explain why one point is more important than another. Don't just say that you will be arranging the items from more important to less important. Explain why the more-important point is more important.

###### Comparison and Contrast 
* in a memo, you compare and contrast the credentials of three finalist for a job. In a proposal to design a new microchip, you compare and contrast two different strategies for designing the chip. In a feasibility report describing a legal challenge that your company faces, you compare and contrast several options for responding
* The first step in comparing and contrasting two or more items is to determint the criteria. MY: (You need a standard and measurement to study the item)

# Chapter 8: Communicating Persuasively

#### Understand Your Audience's Broader Goals
* Security: People resist controversial action that might hurt their own interest. Those who might lose their jobs will likely oppose an argument that their division be eliminated, even if there are many valid reasons to support the argument. Another aspect of security is workload; most people resist an argument that calls for them to work more.
* Recognition: Praise, don't criticize
* Professional Growth: People want to grow on the job. They want to learn new skills and assume new duties.
* Connectness

SKIM: Isn't as detailed as rhetoric

# Chapter 9: Writing Coherent Documents 

When review, ask yourself: 
* Have I left out anything in turning my outline into a draft?
* Have I included all the elements my reader expect to see?
* Have I organized the document logically?
* Is the document persuasive?
* Do I come across as reliable, honest, and helpful?
* Have I present all the elements consistently?
* Is the emphasis appropriate throughout the document?

* Letters are the most formal of the four types of correspondence and therefore most appropriate for communicating with people outside your organization or, in some formal situations, with people within your organization
* Memo: it is moderately formal and therefore appropriate for people in your own organization 
* email: quick, relatively informal 
* microblog: useful for quick questions addressed to a group, most informal

Common types of letters: inquiry letter, response to an inquiry, claim letter

# Chapter 16: Writing Proposals 

* Research Proposal: in a research proposal, you are promising to perform research and then provide a report about it.
* Research proposals often lead to two other applications: progress reports and completion report
* A goods and services proposal is an offer to supply a tangible product, a service, or some combination of the two.
* A proposal is an argument. You msut convince readers that the future benefits will outweigh the immediate and projected costs. Bascailly, you must persuade your readers of three things: that you understand their needs; that you have already determined what you plan to do and that you are able to do it; that you are a professional and are committed to fulfilling your promises
* Describing what you plan to do: Present a complete picture of what you would do from the first day of the project to the last. You need more than enthusiam and good faith, you need a detailed plan showing that you have already started to do the work

### Writing a proposal
The resource you need fall into three basic categories:
* Personnel: Will you have the technical personnel, managers, and support people you will need?
* Facilities. Will you have the facilities, or can you lease them? Can you profitably subcontract tasks to companies that have the right facilities?
* Equipment. Do you have the right equipment? If not, can you buy it or lease it or subcontract the work? Some contracts provide for the purchase of equipment, but others don't
Don't write the proposal unless you are confident that you can carry out the project if you get the go-ahead

Page 449

### The Structure of The Proposal 
* Could include introduction, problem, objectives, solution, methods and resources, and management 
* IFB, RFP
* If the proposal is more than a few pages, provide a summary. Maybe around 250 word. Single spaced, on the title page. Define  the problem in a sentence or two. Next, describe the proposed program and provide a brief statement of your qualification and experience. Some organization wish to see the completion date and the final budget figure in the summary; others prefer that this information be presented separately on the title page along with other identifying information about the supplier and the proposed project 
* Introduction: It should answer the following seven questions: 1. What is the problem or opportunity. use specific monetary term; 2. the purpose of the proposalThe purpose of the proposal is to describe a problem or opportunity and propose activities that will culminate in a deliverable. Be specific in explaining what you want to do; 3. the background of the problem and opportunity. Show then that you understand the problem or opportunity: the circumstances that led to its discovery, the relationships or events that will affect the problem and its solution, and so on; 4.source of information: review relevant literature, ranging from internal reports and memos to published articles or even books, so that readers will understand the context of your work. 5. the scope of the proposal. If appropriate, indicate what you are--and are not--proposing to do. 6. organization of the proposal: explain the organizational pattern; 7. key term you will use in the proposal: if you will use any specialized or unusal terms, define them in the introduction
* Proposed Program: sometimes called the plan of work. Persuade, be specific 
* Qualifications and experience: For a small project, include a few paragraphs describing your technical credentials and those of your co-workers. For larger projects, include the resume of the project leader, and the other important participant.
* Budget: Godo ideas aren't good unless they're affordable. The budget section of a proposal specifies how much the proposed program will cost.
* Appendixes: for example, supporting eltter: a testimonial to the supplier's skill and integrity written by a reputable and well-known person in the field. Two other kinds of appendixes deserve special mention: the task schedule and the description of evaluation techniques. Task Schedule: Gantt chart, network diagram. Description of Evaluation Techniques: Refer to any procedure used to determine whether the proposed program is both effective and efficient. Evaluation techniques can range from simple progress reports to sophisticated statistical analyses. Some proposals for evaluation by an outside agent, such as a consultant, a testing laboratory, or a university. Others describe evaluation techniques that the supplier will perform, such as cost benefit analyses. The issue is some think of quantitative evaluation: like production increases, while others think in terms of qualitative evaluation, such as the workmanship of a product.
* Proposal can be presented as memos or as reports
* There is a proposal sample SKIM

# Chapter 17: Writing Informational Reports
* Field Report, Progress report, incident report, directive, completion report, meeting minute
* There is a sample progress report SKIM, so is incident report SKIM

# Chapter 18: Writing Lab Report
SKIP 

# Chapter 19: Writing Recomendation Reports
* What kinds of questions a recommendation report might address: 1. what should we do about problem X? 2. Should we do Function X? 3. Should we use Technology A or Technology B to do Function X? 4. We currently use Method A to Do Function X. Should we be using Method B.
* Recommendation repot is often called a final report, project report, completion report, or simply a report
* Most recommendation reports discuss questions of feasibility. A feasibility report answers three kinds of questions: Questions of possibility. Questions of economic wisdom. Questions of perception.

# Chapter 20: Writing Definitions, Descriptions, and Instructions

This chapter discusses definitions, descriptions, and instructions. We need to start by defining these three terms:
* A definition is typically a brief explanation of an item or concept using words and (sometimes) graphics. You could write a definition of file format or of regenerative braking.
* A description is typically a longer explanation--usually accompanied by graphics--of an object, mechanism, or process. You could write a description of a wind tubine, or global warming, or a shale-oil extraction
* A set of instruction is a kind of process description, almost always accompanied by graphics, intended to enable a person to carry out a task. You could write a set of instructions for laying a brick patio or for making a playlist for your MP3 player.

### Writing Definitions 
* The world of business and industry depends on clear definitions. Suppose you learn at a job interview that the employer pay tuition and expenses for employees' job-related education. You need to understand, 1. who is an employee? Someone who work for the company, or someone who is full time? What is tuition? including laboratroy or student fees? What is job-related education? Does a course about time management qualify? What constitute education?
* There are three basic types of definitions: parenthetical, sentence, and extended
* A sentence defintion is more formal than a parenthetical definition. Usually follows a standard pattern: the item to be defined is placed in a category of similar items and then distinguished from them. (Hypnoanalysis+is+ a psychoanalytical technique+in which hyponosis is used to elicit information from a patient's unconscious mind)
* Writing extended definition: useful tools: graphics, examples, partition, principle of operation, comparison and contrast, analogy, negation, etymology
* Deciding where to place the definition: 1. in the text. usually for sentence definitions that many or most of your readers will need and for extended definitions of important terms; 2. In a marginal gloss: it is easy to see, and don't interrupt readers who don't need them; 3. in a hyperlink; 4. in a footnote: it is a logical place an occasional sentence definition or extended defintion. Be careful, footnotes can slow readers down by interrupting the flow of the discussion. If you think you will need more than one footnote for a definition on every two to three pages, consider including a glossary; 5. in a glossary: an alphabetized list of definitions--can accommodate sentence definitions and extended definitions of fewer than three or four paragraphs in one convenient location; 6. in an appendix: it is an appropriate place for an extended defintion of one page or longer, which would be cumbersome in a glossary or footnote

### Writing Description
* description is the verbal and visual representation of objects, mechanism, and processes
* object: anything ranging from a physical site, to asynthetic artifact
* mechanism: a synthetic object consisting of a number of identifable parts that work together
* process: an activity that takes place over time: species evolve; steel is made; plant perform photosynthesis.
* consider your audience and your purpose when writing description
* There is no single structure or format used for descriptions. Because description are written for different audiences and different purposes, they can take many shapes and forms. However, the following four suggestions will guide you in most situations: 1. indicate clearly the nature and scope of the description; 2. introduce the description clearly; 3. provide appropriate detail; 4. conclude the description.
* indicating clearly the nature and scope of the description: indicate whether the description is general or particular. For instance, a general description of an object might be entitled "description of a Minivan", and a particular description, "Description of the 2012 Honda Odyssey"
* Introducing the description clearly: you can use graphics, what is the item or process. You can start with a sentence defintion, what is the function of the item or process. What does the item look like?Where and when does the process take place? How does the item work? How does the process work. What are the principal parts of the item. Limit your description to the principal parts. What are the principal steps of the process
* Provide appropriate detail: treat each major part or step as a separate item
* concluding the description: a typical description has a brief conclusion that summarizes it and prevents readers from overemphasizing the part or step discussed last. A common technique for concluding description of mechanism and of some objects is to state briefly how the parts function together. For description of more than a few pages, a discussion of the implications of the process might be appropriate. For example, a description of the Big Bang might conclude with a discussion of how the theory has been supported and challenged by recent astronomical discoveries and theories.
