# Journey_To_Technical_Communication

This time I will read the "Technical Communication" by Mike Markel. Let the learning begin!

All technical communication documents-whether emails, reports, websites, or any of a dozen other forms--are meant to help people learn, carry out tasks, and make decisions.

Example of written communication:
* a memo or email to request information or to identify a problem
* a wiki with instructions that explain how to carry out a new task
* a proposal to persuade management to authorize a project 
* a report to document a completed project 
* an oral presentation to explain a new policy to employees
* inquiry letters, sales letters, goodwill letters, and claim and adjustment letters to customers, clients, and suppliers
* Websites to describe and sell products and to solicit job applications
* Podcasts, videos, and posts on social-networking sites to introduce new products and services
* research reports for external organizations
* articles for trade and professional journals

**Technical communication is the process of finding and using information and sharing meaning**

* Much of what you read every day--textbooks, computer-based training videos, procedure manuals, websites, owner's manuals--is technical communication.

You are likely to have three major roles as a communicator when:
* The writer of a document
* A member of a project team
* An information resource for people inside and outside your organization.

**Almost every technical document has six major characteristics: address particular readers, help reader solve problems, reflects the organization's goal and culture, is produced collaboratively, users design to increase readability, and consists of words or images or both**
* For example, when writing a proposal for your supervisor, you might think of that person's job responsibilities, the level of detail he would be interested in, and personal factors such as history with the organization and attitudes toward your ideas. These factors help you decide what kind of document to write, how to structure it, how much detail to include, and what sentence style and vocabulary to use.
* **Your writing might also be read by people you never intended as your audience: managers and executives in your organization, the public, or the press. Avoid writing anything that will embarass you or your organization if other audience read it.**

# Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations
* right, justice, utility, care
* Your ethical oblication: to your employer, to the public, and to the environment.
* Obligation to your employer: competence and diligence. Generoisity, honesty and candor, confidentiality
* Your legal obligation: copyright law, trademark law, contract law

# Writing Technical Documents 
* Planning, drafting, revising, editing, and proofreading

#### Determining Your Purpose
* Communicating verbs: aurthoize, define, describe, explain, illustrate, inform, outline, present, review, summarize
* Convincing verbs: assess, evaluate, forecast, propose, recommend, request
* gaining management's approval: before you actually start to write an outline or gather the information you need, spend another 10 or 15 mintues making sure your primary reader agrees with your thinking by submitting to your supervisor a brief description of your plans. You don't want to waste days or even weeks working on a document that won't fulfill its purose. If you have misunderstood what your supervisor wants, it is far easier to fix the problem at this early stage.

Here is an example of the description you might submit to your boss about the CAD's equipment. In composing this description of her plan, the writer drew on audience profile sheets for her two principle readers. She describes a logical, rational strategy for proposing the equipment purchase.

Juan:
Please tell me if you think this is a good approach for the proposal on CAD equipment.(the purpose of the memo)    
Outright purchase of the complete system will cost more than $1,000, so you would have to approve it and send it on for Tina’s approval. (I’ll provide leasing costs as well.) I want to show that our CAD hardware and software are badly out­of­date and need to be replaced. I’ll be thorough in recommending new equipment, with independent evaluations in the literature, as well as product demonstrations. The proposal should specify what the current equipment is costing us and show how much we can save by buying the recommended system.
(a statement of the audience of the proposal, a statement of the purpose, follwed by early statement of the scope of the document)

I’ll call you later today to get your reaction before I begin researching what’s available.
Renu (a statement of how the writer intends to follow up on this memo)
