# Journey_To_Technical_Communication

This time I will read the "Technical Communication" by Mike Markel. Let the learning begin!

All technical communication documents-whether emails, reports, websites, or any of a dozen other forms--are meant to help people learn, carry out tasks, and make decisions.

Example of written communication:
* a memo or email to request information or to identify a problem
* a wiki with instructions that explain how to carry out a new task
* a proposal to persuade management to authorize a project 
* a report to document a completed project 
* an oral presentation to explain a new policy to employees
* inquiry letters, sales letters, goodwill letters, and claim and adjustment letters to customers, clients, and suppliers
* Websites to describe and sell products and to solicit job applications
* Podcasts, videos, and posts on social-networking sites to introduce new products and services
* research reports for external organizations
* articles for trade and professional journals

**Technical communication is the process of finding and using information and sharing meaning**

* Much of what you read every day--textbooks, computer-based training videos, procedure manuals, websites, owner's manuals--is technical communication.

You are likely to have three major roles as a communicator when:
* The writer of a document
* A member of a project team
* An information resource for people inside and outside your organization.

**Almost every technical document has six major characteristics: address particular readers, help reader solve problems, reflects the organization's goal and culture, is produced collaboratively, users design to increase readability, and consists of words or images or both**
* For example, when writing a proposal for your supervisor, you might think of that person's job responsibilities, the level of detail he would be interested in, and personal factors such as history with the organization and attitudes toward your ideas. These factors help you decide what kind of document to write, how to structure it, how much detail to include, and what sentence style and vocabulary to use.
* **Your writing might also be read by people you never intended as your audience: managers and executives in your organization, the public, or the press. Avoid writing anything that will embarass you or your organization if other audience read it.**

# Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations
* right, justice, utility, care
* Your ethical oblication: to your employer, to the public, and to the environment.
* Obligation to your employer: competence and diligence. Generoisity, honesty and candor, confidentiality
* Your legal obligation: copyright law, trademark law, contract law
